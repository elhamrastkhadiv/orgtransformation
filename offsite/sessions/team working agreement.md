# Team working agreements

Working agreements are guidelines used by the team to describe how they want to work together. 
We are going to create between 5 and 10 agreements that describe positive behaviours that everyone believes in. 
These agreements will help us to have a shared sense of responsibility and empower us to lead according to these guidelines.

### Tips:

* To facilitate this, introduce the idea and gives a few examples.
* Use dot voting to select the most important ones.

### Here are some examples:

* Meetings start and end on time and have an agenda.

* Everyone has equal voice and valuable contribution.

* We make commitments as a team.
