## Wish Retro


### Safety check
ask 2-3 questions to break the ice: team memeber can put a dot in nested circle to show how much they agree or disagree.
 the center of circle is the center of agreement

* I feel I can talk openly in this Retrospective
* I am happy with the quality of our code
* I feel I'm part of the best team ever


### Step 2:

give participants 10 min to write stickies for following categories:

1: wish list before merging the team(past)
2: things we have done/ achieved(now)
3: wish list for future(feature)
