## Wish Retro


### Safety check
ask 2-3 questions to break the ice: team memeber can put a dot in nested circle to show how much they agree or disagree.
 the center of circle is the center of agreement

* I feel I can talk openly in this Retrospective (Green)
* I am happy with the quality of our code (Pink)
* I feel I'm part of the best team ever (Orange)

### Step 2:

give participants 10 min to write stickies for following categories:

1: wish list before merging the team(past)
2: things we have done/ achieved(now)
3: wish list for future(feature)

### Finding from our team:

#### Past:
* Being part of a team, communication, purpose,clear goal was missing. 
* There was a Silo within the team
* Team was not happy with the quality of the code


#### Now
* Team is happy with team communication, team working
* Pair-programming is happening
* Less silo 
* Less meeting
* Collaborate more with other team


#### Future
* Having wider impact of product decision
* Make other envious: Make a team which other people want to join(By being more clear on our goal and capacity and push back on things which does not make sense)
* Improve code quality
