## Wish Retro


### Safety check
ask 2-3 questions to break the ice: team memeber can put a dot in nested circle to show how much they agree or disagree.
 the center of circle is the center of agreement

* I feel I can talk openly in this Retrospective (Green)
* I am happy with the quality of our code (Pink)
* I feel I'm part of the best team ever (Orange)
